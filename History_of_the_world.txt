HISTORY OF THE WORLD:
A couple of centuries ago, an event occurred on the continent of Troens that changed the course of history forever.

On a cold autumn day, the 12th of 804, the sky lit up so brightly that observers were temporarily blinded. Enormous blue rays struck the ground, hitting people who experienced a sudden surge of strength.

After the rays disappeared, the nobility tried to determine what had happened. Groups of soldiers were sent to investigate and discovered previously unknown beings—people who had been affected by the rays.

They resembled animals; some had long ears, while others were extremely short.

By 806, these creatures were called elves, dwarves, and beastmen.

At the same time, many humans began to manifest so-called magical abilities.

The situation quickly escalated. By 807, humans had begun oppressing the newly emerged races. Soon, protests broke out among the elves, dwarves, and beastmen, leading to chaos. This event became known in history as the "Human Genocide."

The situation was further complicated by the sudden appearance of monsters in forests and dungeons, seemingly out of nowhere—also linked to the magical rays.


GUILDS AND HUNTERS:
To protect civilians, adventurer guilds were established in large cities. Over time, they spread to smaller settlements, hiring volunteers to hunt monsters.


LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD:
By the 45th day of spring, year 995, five main languages had emerged:

Common – Used by almost all races, created for communication between kingdoms.
Parian – The language of humans.
Maur – The language of beastmen.
Elven – The language of elves.
Zorgo – The language of dwarves.
There are also monster languages, but no one understands them.

KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD:
There are four kingdoms, three of which are located on the continent of Troens:

Marco – The kingdom of the beastmen (south of the continent).
Zekko – The kingdom of the dwarves (west).
Maonna – The kingdom of the elves (north).
Eastern Union – The kingdom of humans, located on the Eastern Island.
WAR BETWEEN HUMANS AND BEASTMEN:
Currently, a war is ongoing between the Eastern Union and Marco.

The conflict began due to the enslavement of beastmen by humans. The beastmen have sworn to free their kin and will not end the war until their people are liberated.

Brief information about the kingdoms:
Elves are renowned for their deep connection with nature. Some can summon familiars in the form of fairies.
Dwarves are known for their craftsmanship and rich mines.
Beastmen are masters of survival; their settlements are found in arid lands and jungles.
Humans have achieved supremacy in shipbuilding, giving them an advantage on the seas and allowing trade with Zekko.


MAGIC AND MYSTERIES:
Monsters and Their Origins:
Monsters inhabit forests and dungeons, which continue to appear to this day. The sources of the magic that creates them remain unknown.

Dragons have not been seen for a long time. Legends claim they existed in ancient times, but there is no evidence.


THE ORDER OF MAGES:
An ancient secret organization known as the Order of the Golden Star exists in the world.

They study magic and guard knowledge that could be dangerous in the wrong hands.
The Order is based in a lost mountain city, protected by powerful spells.
A representative of any race may join the Order, but they must pass difficult trials.


LEGENDS AND MYTHS:
The Crystal of Eternity:
It is said that this artifact grants its owner eternal life. However, no one knows if it truly exists.

Guardians of Darkness:
A mysterious race that inhabits the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world.

They embody fear and death. Their magic is powerful and incomprehensible.
Many consider them a myth, but rumors persist.

Portals:
Scattered throughout the world are mysterious portals that can transport people across great distances.
They are hidden and unknown to most, and only a select few know how to use them.


CONCLUSION:
This world is filled with secrets, magic, and conflict. Powerful kingdoms, ancient organizations, dangerous monsters, and mysterious artifacts shape its destiny.

What does the future hold? No one knows...
