HISTORY OF THE WORLD:
A couple of centuries ago, an event occurred on the continent of Troens that changed the course of history forever.
On a cold autumn day, the 12th of 804, the sky lit up so brightly that observers were temporarily blinded. Enormous blue rays struck the ground, hitting people who experienced a sudden surge of strength.
After the rays disappeared, the nobility tried to determine what had happened. Groups of soldiers were sent to investigate and discovered previously unknown beings—people who had been affected by the rays.
They resembled animals; some had long ears, while others were extremely short.
By 806, these creatures were called elves, dwarves, and beastmen.
At the same time, many humans began to manifest so-called magical abilities.

The situation quickly escalated. 
By 807, humans had begun oppressing the newly emerged races. Soon, protests broke out among the elves, dwarves, and beastmen, leading to chaos. 
This event became known in history as the "Human Genocide."
The situation was further complicated by the sudden appearance of monsters in forests and dungeons, 
seemingly out of nowhere—also linked to the magical rays.

By the 45th day of spring, year 995, five main languages had emerged.
