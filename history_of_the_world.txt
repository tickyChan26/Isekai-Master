A couple of centuries ago, at a time when dragons shared lands with humans alone, an event occurred on the continent of "Troens" that changed the course of history forever.
On one cold 12th autumn day in the year 804, the entire human race watched everything, the sky lit up so brightly that those who watched went blind for a short period of time.
Huge blue rays hit the planet's soil, thereby striking people, who at first experienced a great surge of strength. When the rays stopped falling, everyone was perplexed, all the nobility
tried to figure out what it was, sending groups of soldiers for reconnaissance and searching for victims, they discovered previously unknown creatures that were hit by blue rays, they looked like animals,
some had large long ears or extremely short stature.
It is the year 806, all those who were struck by the rays began to be called: elves, dwarves and beastmen. Many people began to show abilities, as they were then called "Magic abilities".
The situation became increasingly tense when people began to oppress other races, in 807, protests broke out among elves, dwarves and beastmen. There was complete chaos on the mainland,
this event was called the "Human Genocide". The situation was aggravated by previously unknown monsters that began to appear in the forests and in the so-called dungeons, which also appeared out of nowhere and
arise to this day.
In large cities, and later in smaller cities, private guilds began to open, which hired volunteers, they in turn hunted monsters while protecting civilians.
It was the year 995, the 45th day of spring,
In the world, 5 languages ​​were invented:
The first is "Common" which is spoken by almost all races, it was invented for communication between kingdoms,
The second is "Parian" which is spoken by people,
The third is "Maur" which is spoken by beastmen,
The fourth is "Elven" which is spoken by elves and
The fifth is "Zorgo" which is spoken by dwarves.
Of course, there are also different languages ​​of monsters, but no one understands them.

As for dragons, no one has seen them for a long time, only legends are circulating that they once existed there, monsters, as usual, walk through forests and dungeons,
The sources of magic that create them have not yet been identified.
There are four kingdoms, three of which are located on the continent of "Troens":
The first kingdom of "Marco" beastmen, which is located in the south of the continent,
The second kingdom of the dwarves "Zekko" is located in the west,
The third kingdom of the elves called "Maonna" is located in the north and
The last kingdom of people "Eastern Union" is located on an island that was nicknamed "Eastern".

Being a human is not easy, since there is a war between the kingdom of "Eastern Union" and "Marco", it all began when people began to enslave every beastman they saw.
The beastmen, in turn, promised to return all their brothers from slavery and until this condition is met, there is a war.
The Kingdom of the Elves is famous for its unity with nature, some individuals can even summon familiars in the form of fairies. The Dwarven Kingdom is famous for its craftsmanship and rich lands.
Beastmen are masters of survival, so most of their settlements are in arid lands and jungles.
Humans, on the other hand, have greatly advanced in shipbuilding technology, which allows them to maintain superiority in the water and trade between their kingdom and "Zekko".

There are other mysterious creatures in the world, such as the living dead, golems, demons, goblins, mutant spiders and many others who live outside the law and do not recognize any kings or rules.

Their existence remains a mystery to most of the world's inhabitants.

An ancient order of magicians called the "Order of the Golden Star" was founded in this world. They study magic and guard knowledge that can be dangerous in the wrong hands.

They have their own city, which is located in the mountains, protected by powerful spells. Members of the order can be of any race, but they must pass difficult tests before
gaining recognition and becoming members of the order.

There is also a legend about a magical artifact called the "Crystal of Eternity". It is said that this crystal has extraordinary power and can give its owner eternal life.
However, no one knows where it is or even if it really exists.

In addition, there is a mysterious race known as the "Keepers of Darkness". They live in the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world and serve as the embodiment of fear and death.

Their magic is strong and incomprehensible, but they are considered a myth, and no one knows what really happens beyond the light of their lair.

There are also mysterious portals in the world that can transport people to different parts of the world. They are hidden and only those who know their location can use them.

As for magic and various abilities:
controlling two or three elements at once is a great rarity, and control over all of them at once is out of the question.

Magic consists of the elements of water, fire, earth, air, electricity. 
There is also minor magic such as healing, but it is related to self-made magic, as well as various abilities
like "cutting blade", which also uses magical power, but much less than some magic spells and depends more on the strength of the performer.
But spells require good intelligence and ability in magic.
Usually spells are pronounced out loud, only strong magicians can do silent magic.
"Special techniques" are called so, because everyone can come up with a spell for themselves that will perform the intended, for example, sealing monsters, the main thing is to have great knowledge in a certain area.
