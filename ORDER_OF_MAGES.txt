THE ORDER OF MAGES
An ancient secret organization known as the Order of the Golden Star exists in the world.
They study magic and guard knowledge that could be dangerous in the wrong hands.
The Order is based in a lost mountain city, protected by powerful spells.
A representative of any race may join the Order, but they must pass difficult trials.
